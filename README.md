# NixOS Config

My NixOS config for my machines.

Still a work in progress to my base stable system, but mostly there.

- Hyprland is functional and configurable through Home Manager
- Audio input/output and Discord are functional
  - Discord video/audio streaming untested but should be functional
- Nvidia and CUDA were a breeze and games through Steam are functional
- ffmpeg/Handbrake were a breeze and appear functional
