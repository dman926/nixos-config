# NixOS Config

My NixOS/Flake/Home Manager config for my machines.

The base system is stable and complete with my usual items:

- Hyprland with a status bar (waybar) and notifications (mako), and backgrounds (swww)
- A web browser (Google Chrome)
- VSCode FHS
- Steam
- Discord
- ffmpeg with CUDA acceleration
